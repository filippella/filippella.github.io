<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In relation to this Disease, different information is coming out on a daily basis, from different bodies. Some of them are contradictory with each other. Thus, the purpose of compiling this information is to make further contribution to enabling our people to have a better understanding in various languages (including Amharic), based on more reliable sources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would also like to confess that there is no full knowledge and information on this particular infection as it is very new.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The naming of the Disease</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation called this Disease as <strong>Coronavirus Disease 2019</strong> on the 11<sup>th</sup> of February 2019. In short, it is called <strong>COVID-19</strong>, derived from &lsquo;CO&rsquo; for Corona, &lsquo;VI&rsquo; for Virus and &lsquo;D&rsquo; for Disease. The number &lsquo;19&rsquo; refers to the year the Disease was first identified, which was 2019. It was called Corona because its shape looks like a Crown when observed under a Photomicrograph (from the Latin word &lsquo;Corona&rsquo;, meaning a Crown in English).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COVID-19 is a new disease. This contagious new disease is caused by a new Coronavirus which is believed not to have been seen in humans before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the Virus enters the body mainly through the respiratory tract when one inhales droplets from an infected person&rsquo;s coughs and sneezes. Problems can range from mild respiratory complications to an acute Pneumonia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reports of fatalities by 07 April 2020 are alarming, indeed. World-wide, the reported number of total cases is 1,386,820, out of whom 297,583 people have recovered while 79,068 people have sadly lost their lives. The reported number of deaths in the most affected countries is as follows: 17,127 in Italy, 13,897 in Spain, 11,785 in the United States of America, 8,911 in France and 6,159 in the United Kingdom. These are only few samples presented as examples but there are similar problems almost everywhere in the World. The numbers are increasing my minutes even while I am typing this report. As the spread has become a world-wide pandemic, we need to take a very good care wherever we are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on available evidence so far, the symptoms of this disease/infection appear to include the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fever</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dry cough</strong></li>
<li><strong>Breathing difficulties</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pneumonia in a severe case</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In some infected people, the signs of aches, blockage of nasal cavities, running nose, soar throats and diarrhoea have been observed</strong>. If you had close physical associations with infected people and/or show the above &nbsp;&nbsp;symptoms, please try to seek medical support as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>How Coronavirus Disease 2019 spreads</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coronavirus is believed to spread mainly from person to person. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets can be discharges through the mouth and/or nose. The spread of the virus takes place when these droplets land in the mouths or noses of persons who are nearby. It can also be inhaled into the lungs. The chance of the spread is very high among people who are close to each other by less than 2-3 metre. This includes handshakes and similar body contacts. That is why strong recommendations are made for infected people not to come in close contact with any person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you touch your mouth, nose or probably even your eyes after touching the objects or surfaces that have viruses on them, it may also be possible &nbsp;to get the Coronavirus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Coronavirus Disease 2019 was first identified in Wuhan, China, it has soon become a world-wide pandemic, affecting every country in the World. Although the exact extent of its spread in Ethiopia is not known, many people are getting affected , and a very good care is expected at all levels &ndash; from individual and groups to government departments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Measures to be taken to control the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the following list is not exclusive or authoritative, it includes most of the recommended actions to control the spread of this most devastating corona virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corona virus is spread mainly from person to person. Surprisingly, it is also reported that the virus can spread from a person who has not yet shown any symptoms.</strong></li>
<li><strong>It is thus very important to keep distances from other people by at least 2 metres.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wash your hands repeatedly with soap and water (preferably warm water) for up to about 20 seconds.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If infected, please do not go out unless you want to go the medical centres; isolate yourself at home or in medical centres until you fully recover.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cover your mouth and nose with tissues or the inside of your elbow when you cough or sneeze. Through the used tissues in safe places such as bins.</strong></li>
<li><strong>As much as possible, avoid touching your mouth, nose and even eyes.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Repeatedly clean and if possible, disinfect the objects and surfaces you frequently touch such as doorknobs, light switches, phones, desks, toilets, sinks, etc. to remove the virus.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you have to go to crowded areas, wear masks and gloves if possible. When you return, dispose the masks and gloves safely and wash your hands with soap, </strong></li>
<li><strong>If possible take a well balanced diet to build up your body&rsquo;s defence mechanism and immunity.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a vaccine has not yet been found for this deadly virus, the biggest responsibility is to protect yourself against the virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This virus is affecting people all over the World, regardless of race, age, locality or social status. The poor, the sick and the weak of course are always more victims. We thus call on responsible bodies, from individuals, groups and organisations to Government departments to play positive roles to support the population, especially the most disadvantaged vulnerable groups, while praying for peace and stability.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>May Our Almighty God Have Mercy On Us All????.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>With all our best wishes.</strong></p>
